== PURPOSE:

*{bpm_process_signalling}*

One of the main features of a Business Process Management (BPM) solution is the capability to manage wait-states of long running business process instances. 
Typically, a process instance waiting in a _wait-state_ node is _signalled_ to have it resume execution and advance to the next node in the process definition. 
Red Hatâ€™s BPM Suite product includes extensive support for signalling of long running process instances in a wait-state.

Signalling of a process instance can be done through an external trigger. 
This reference architecture includes examples of process instances via {etrigger}.

In some use cases, you might want to trigger a process instance in a wait-state from _within_ another process instance.
This reference architecture also provides a deep-dive into the use of {itrigger} as well.
