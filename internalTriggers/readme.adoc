== PURPOSE:

*{bpm_process_signalling}*

One of the main features of a Business Process Management (BPM) solution is the capability to manage wait-states of long running business process instances. Typically, a process instance waiting in a _wait-state_ node is _signalled_ to have it resume execution and advance to the next node in the process definition. Red Hatâ€™s BPM Suite 6 product includes extensive support for signalling of long running process instances in a wait-state.

Signalling of a process instance can be done through an external trigger. But in some use cases, you might want to trigger a process instance in a wait-state from _within_ another process instance. The purpose of this reference architecture is to deep-dive into this particular use case. Signalling through external triggers has been covered in {bpm_bpmn2}.
